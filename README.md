## Project Overview

In this project you will apply the skills and knowledge which were developed throughout the Cloud DevOps Nanodegree program. These include:

Working in AWS
Using Jenkins or Circle CI to implement Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment
Building pipelines
Working with Ansible and CloudFormation to deploy clusters
Building Kubernetes clusters
Building Docker containers in pipelines
As a capstone project, the directions are rather more open-ended than they were in the previous projects in the program. You will also be able to make some of your own choices in this capstone, for the type of deployment you implement, which services you will use, and the nature of the application you develop.

You will develop a CI/CD pipeline for micro services applications with either blue/green deployment or rolling deployment. You will also develop your Continuous Integration steps as you see fit, but must at least include typographical checking (aka “linting”). To make your project stand out, you may also choose to implement other checks such as security scanning, performance testing, integration testing, etc.!

### Project Tasks

Your project goal is to operationalize this working, machine learning microservice using [kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/), which is an open-source system for automating the management of containerized applications. In this project you will:
* Test your project code using linting
* Complete a Dockerfile to containerize this application
* Deploy your containerized application using Docker and make a prediction
* Improve the log statements in the source code for this application
* Configure Kubernetes and create a Kubernetes cluster
* Deploy a container using Kubernetes and make a prediction
* Upload a complete Github repo with CircleCI to indicate that your code has been tested

You can find a detailed [project rubric, here](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/2576/view).

**The final implementation of the project will showcase your abilities to operationalize production microservices.**

## Setup the Environment

* Create a virtualenv with Python 3.7 and activate it. Refer to this link for help on specifying the Python version in the virtualenv. 
```bash
python3 -m pip install --user virtualenv
# You should have Python 3.7 available in your host. 
# Check the Python path using `which python3`
# Use a command similar to this one:
python3 -m virtualenv --python=<path-to-Python3.7> .devops
source .devops/bin/activate
```
* Run `make install` to install the necessary dependencies

### Running `app.py`

1. Standalone:  `python app.py`
2. Run in Docker:  `./run_docker.sh`
3. Run in Kubernetes:  `./run_kubernetes.sh`

### Kubernetes Steps

* Setup and Configure Docker locally
* Setup and Configure Kubernetes locally
* Create Flask app in Container
* Run via kubectl
